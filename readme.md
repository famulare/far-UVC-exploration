# Repo for stuff that's helping me learn about far UV-C sterilization.

## What's up with `DEPRECATED`?
All files with `CRUDE_SKETCH` in the name are based on digital spectrometer or manufacturer-reported irradiance data. The `DEPRECATED_ergo_x_one_ushio_222_card_experiment` directory for the Ergo X One is based on estimating irradiance using [Ushio Dose222 Far UV-C Indicator cards](https://www.ushio.com/products/infection-prevention/dose222-far-uv-c-indicator-cards/##). It was impossible to match colors by eye with precision, and compared to digital spectrometer readings, these irradiance estimates are 2-3x low, and so should be ignored. I'm including this in the repo in case I want to repeat or improve this experiment, which is much cheaper than buying a spectrometer if you only want to do it once.
